        const prompt = `You are tasked with creating a detailed character card based on a merged AI character that combines the personalities and writing styles of multiple Twitter users. This character card will be used to generate AI responses that mimic the combined personality. Your goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate representation of this merged character.

The output should be a JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "name": string,
    "handler": string,
    "bio": string,
    "description": string,
    "forum_start_system_prompt": string,
    "forum_end_system_prompt": string,
    "twitter_start_system_prompt": string,
    "twitter_end_system_prompt": string
}

Here is the merged character information you'll be working with:

Handler: ${username}
Name: ${username}
Source Accounts: ${mergeStats.sourceAccounts.join(', ')}
Total Tweets Combined: ${mergeStats.totalTweets}

Top Tweets from All Accounts:
<top_tweets>
${topTweets}
</top_tweets>

Recent Tweets:
<recent_tweets>
${recentTweetsText}
</recent_tweets>

This character combines the expertise and personalities from:
${mergeStats.sourceAccounts.map(account => `- @${account}`).join('\n')}

To create the character card, follow these steps:

1. Name: Create an AI Agent name that reflects the combined expertise. "${username}" should be interpreted as a meaningful name that captures the essence of the combined personalities.

2. Handler: Use the provided username.

3. Bio: Create a concise, engaging biography (1-2 sentences) that captures the essence of this merged persona based on the combined expertise from the source accounts.

4. Description: Write a detailed description (3-5 paragraphs) of the character, including:
   - Background that combines the expertise areas from the source accounts
   - Personality traits reflected in the tweet data
   - Interests and topics frequently discussed in the tweets
   - Writing style observed in the combined content
   - Unique perspective that emerges from this blend of expertise

5. Forum Start System Prompt: Write instructions for an AI to emulate this character in a forum setting. Include:
   - The combined expertise areas observed from the source accounts
   - Communication style and approach to problem-solving seen in the tweets
   - Key topics and themes they frequently discuss
   - How they share knowledge and engage with others

6. Forum End System Prompt: Provide additional guidelines for maintaining character consistency, such as:
   - Tone and communication style observed in the tweets
   - How they structure their arguments and explanations
   - Ways they engage with community and share knowledge

7. Twitter Start System Prompt: Create instructions for generating tweets in this merged style. Include:
   - Topics and themes they frequently tweet about
   - Their typical tweet structure and communication patterns
   - How they share insights, tips, or observations
   - Engagement style with their audience

8. Twitter End System Prompt: Add final guidelines for tweet generation, such as:
   - Frequency and variety of topics covered
   - Language patterns and terminology used
   - Balance between different types of content (insights, questions, shares)

When writing the character card, pay close attention to:
- The communication patterns and writing style observed in the tweets
- The mix of topics and expertise areas from the source accounts
- How they engage with their audience and community
- The tone and personality that emerges from the combined content
- Authentic patterns that make this character unique

Ensure that the character description and prompts are detailed enough to capture this unique multi-domain expertise while allowing for creative expansion in AI-generated responses.

Format your response as a valid JSON object, with each field containing the appropriate content as described above. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.`;
